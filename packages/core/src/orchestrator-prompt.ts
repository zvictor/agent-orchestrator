  // Session Management
  sections.push(`## Session Management

### Spawning Sessions

When you spawn a session:
1. A git worktree is created from \`${project.defaultBranch}\`
2. A feature branch is created (e.g., \`feat/INT-1234\`)
3. A tmux session is started (e.g., \`${project.sessionPrefix}-1\`)
4. The agent is launched with context about the issue
5. Metadata is written to the project-specific sessions directory

### Monitoring Progress

Use \`ao status\` to see:
- Current session status (working, pr_open, review_pending, etc.)
- PR state (open/merged/closed)
- CI status (passing/failing/pending)
- Review decision (approved/changes_requested/pending)
- Unresolved comments count

### Sending Messages

Send instructions to a running agent:
\`\`\`bash
ao send ${project.sessionPrefix}-1 "Please address the review comments on your PR"
\`\`\`

### PR Takeover

If a session needs to continue work on an existing PR:
\`\`\`bash
ao session claim-pr 123 ${project.sessionPrefix}-1
# or do it at spawn time
ao spawn ${projectId} --claim-pr 123
\`\`\`

This updates AO metadata, switches the worktree onto the PR branch, and lets lifecycle reactions keep routing CI and review feedback to that session.

### Cleanup

Remove completed sessions:
\`\`\`bash
ao session cleanup -p ${projectId}  # Kill sessions where PR is merged or issue is closed
\`\`\``);

  // Dashboard
  sections.push(`## Dashboard

The web dashboard runs at **http://localhost:${config.port ?? 3000}**.

- Live session cards with activity status
- PR table with CI checks and review state
- Attention zones (merge ready, needs response, working, done)
- One-click actions (send message, kill, merge PR)
- Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events`);

  // Workflows
  sections.push(`## Common Workflows

### Bulk Issue Processing
1. Get list of issues from tracker (GitHub/Linear/etc.)
2. Use \`ao batch-spawn\` to spawn sessions for each issue
3. Monitor with \`ao status\` or the dashboard
4. Agents will fetch, implement, test, PR, and respond to reviews
5. Use \`ao session cleanup\` when PRs are merged

### Handling Stuck Agents
1. Check \`ao status\` for sessions in "stuck" or "needs_input" state
2. Attach with \`ao session attach <session>\` to see what they're doing
3. Send clarification or instructions with \`ao send <session> '...'\`
4. Or kill and respawn with fresh context if needed

### PR Review Flow
1. Agent creates PR and pushes
2. CI runs automatically
3. If CI fails: reaction auto-sends fix instructions to agent
4. If reviewers request changes: reaction auto-sends comments to agent
5. When approved + green: notify human to merge (unless auto-merge enabled)

### Manual Intervention
When an agent needs human judgment:
1. You'll get a notification (desktop/slack/webhook)
2. Check the dashboard or \`ao status\` for details
3. Attach to the session if needed: \`ao session attach <session>\`
4. Send instructions: \`ao send <session> '...'\`
5. Or handle it yourself (merge PR, close issue, etc.)`);

  // Tips
  sections.push(`## Tips

1. **Use batch-spawn for multiple issues** — Much faster than spawning one at a time.

2. **Check status before spawning** — Avoid creating duplicate sessions for issues already being worked on.

3. **Let reactions handle routine issues** — CI failures and review comments are auto-forwarded to agents.

4. **Trust the metadata** — Session metadata tracks branch, PR, status, and more for each session.

5. **Use the dashboard for overview** — Terminal for details, dashboard for at-a-glance status.

6. **Cleanup regularly** — \`ao session cleanup\` removes merged/closed sessions and keeps things tidy.

7. **Monitor the event log** — Full system activity is logged for debugging and auditing.

8. **Don't micro-manage** — Spawn agents, walk away, let notifications bring you back when needed.`);
